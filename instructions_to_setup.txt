rails new trello -d mysql
adding user name and password to database.yml
creating two databases in myqsl console with same name
granting permissoins to those data bases -> command 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON trello_test.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
user i have created for the first time
rails db:schema:dump -> to see data base connection is working or not
rails g devise User -> to generate model of user
rails g model User and rails db:migrate -> rails console(restart server)
IMP -> TO generate model use rails g model Board -> it will automatically generate model file ,migtration file called by active record and test units

if we generate migration to create data base then we have to create model/board.rb to see the Board object in console and in other app


->>> this branch in on development -> using postgress
rails db:system:change -to=postgresql --> that changed to postgress
and then 
we create and migrate on db
rails db:create db:migrate
